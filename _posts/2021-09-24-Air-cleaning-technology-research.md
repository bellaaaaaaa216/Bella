<Br>Air bubbles create a clean air microclimate for children, this is a real clean air bubble in the center of Warsaw.
<Br>Comprehensive technology is used for advanced integration of photosynthesis in the built environment.
<Br>Air bubbles invented a new type of building. It uses a cylindrical wood structure and is wrapped in an ETFE membrane that protects 52 glass algae reactors.
   <Br> This creates a real urban algae greenhouse. The space is equipped with ropes, foot pumps and bouncing balls, and can be used as a playground and outdoor classroom. The white bubble noise of the algae gardening system masks the surrounding urban noise and provides a calm atmosphere in which to play and interact.

  <Br>The architectural form of the playground structure enhances the filtering process. ETFE film-an evolution of the photosynthetic urban curtain system shown by ecoLogicStudio in Dublin in 2018-controls the microclimate in the air bubbles. The inverted cone roof membrane further stimulates air circulation and natural ventilation, thereby keeping the play area clean.
The air bubble monitoring system integrates urban air pollution sensors and is connected to a data processing platform that can compare measured values ​​in real time and highlight the air quality index of six core pollutants: fine particulate matter PM2.5 and PM 10, ground Ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Air bubbles can absorb 97% nitrogen and 75% particulate matter.
Data collected as early as May 2021 showed that the concentration of PM2.5 in the playground was far below the limit recommended by the WHO (green space, air quality index below 20). The peak decline rate is 83%, which is impressive.
Air bubbles contained 52 large bioreactors in 520 liters of live green borosilicate glass. Chlorella can filter 200 liters/min of air polluting algae culture. When the liquid medium washes the particles, the algae will actively eat polluting molecules and carbon dioxide, thereby releasing fresh clean oxygen.

  <Br>Air quality is a serious issue that needs to be addressed as more and more people move to large cities. At the same time, we are losing the forests that help us combat air pollution, which means that pollution promises to be a major health threat in coming decades. The Chlorella Pavilion addresses that need, taking inspiration from the air purifying process that occurs in nature.
